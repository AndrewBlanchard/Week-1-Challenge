# Andrew Blanchard Week 1 Challenge
I improved the html and css code using seo practices like providing alt text to all images as well as making sure the code is well structured and is in semantical order. 

## Usage:
  This webpage details the benefits of incorporating proper seo practices to grow your business and brand. It features a navigation bar centered at the top of the screen that links to key topics on the webpage. Each image is given the proper alt text to describe the image in detail if a user has trouble loading the content. 
## Adding Alt text to improve SEO capabilities.
